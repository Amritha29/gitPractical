                            JAVA WEB SERVICES



WEB SERVICES : sharing info between two unknown applications(2 servers) designes using unknown technologies.

TWO major classes
1) REST
2) SOAP 

uses either xml or json
- xml is heavily used in SOAP web services

json format:
{ 
  "first_name"  :  "Sammy", 
  "last_name"   :  "Shark", 
  "online"      :  true 
}

Javascript Object Notation(JSON)
lihtweight text based open standard designed for human redeable data interchange
used for serializing(converting data into byte stream) and transmitting
Transmit data(name/value) btw server and web appl
Curly braces stores the object
json parses obj itself but xml parses value.

JSONObject obj=new JSONObject();
- for processing we need some jar files 

REST and SOAP

webservice will give output either in xml or json format by using ywo technologies soap or rest

In ws there are producer(services) and clients

properties of ws
self-contained
loosely-oupled
web-enabled
languauge-independent and interoperable

AXIS(SOAP)
JERSEY(REST)

// B2B integration

Communication layer:  httpor  https layer  and also more specialized transport mech such as eg ; JMS 
SOAP - xml based protocol for accessing web services
platform independent

WSDL interface between ws appl

UDDI-  describing, discovering and integrating web services

REST is not protocol it s architectural style which uses soap to send data
return valus in htnml,xml, json ,plain text

soap is slower

implementation of soap- jax-ws(rpc style and document style) implemented in java 1.6
     "        "  rest - jax-rs(jersey and RESTEasy ) 
 
SOA - design pattern
provides services to other application through protocol

REST can access in any of the websites where soap is accessed only in systems
Basiclly it s stateless  in nature 
CLienr/server + request/response
Everything is a resource it can create CRUD operations
